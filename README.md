### Hi! this is my first actual C Project!

# Text Editor using C

I am following a really good guide to create a text editor from scratch using C by [snaptoken](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/)
I plan to learn core C concepts by making this project!

---

With the completion of the guide I've finally been able to understand a LOT about how complicated C can be (I hate memory management now >_< >) ughhhh.....
I was stuck in typos once every 10-15 minutes and ifnding the source was even more troublesome... but all in all, It was all definitely worth it!

Now, I'm gonna start making some changes to the code made with the guide and add a few of my own features!

---

## My Features:
- Added Undo and Redo Functionality
- Changed the colors of the entire editor to match my hyprland theme (Rose Pine) cuz why not? I added colors to much more elements than provided in the guide too! (Do note that I did use ChatGPT to find ANSI values for each individual color in the palette)
- Added a help page to list all commands

I guess all this is just about enough for concluding this project? I could certainly add more stuff like Copy-Paste, (Find and) Replace feature, line numbers before every line, among many others but I have already used up too much of my time on this project (way more than I initially expected) and the fact that this project was just to learn C has already been completed satisfactorily so I am done.

Peace.
