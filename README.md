### Hi! this is my first actual C Project!

# Text Editor using C

I am following a really good guide to create a text editor from scratch using C by [snaptoken](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/)
I plan to learn core C concepts by making this project!

---

With the completion of the guide I've finally been able to understand a LOT about how complicated C can be (I hate memory management now >_< >) ughhhh.....
I was stuck in typos once every 10-15 minutes and ifnding the source was even more troublesome... but all in all, It was all definitely worth it!

Now, I'm gonna start making some changes to the code made with the guide and add a few of my own features!

## My Features:
- Added Undo and Redo Functionality
